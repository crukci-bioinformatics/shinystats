# Shiny app for one-sample and two-sample statistical tests

This Shiny app was developed for the [Introduction to Statistical Analysis](http://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/IntroductionToStats)
training course run by the [Bioinformatics Core](https://www.cruk.cam.ac.uk/core-facilities/bioinformatics-core) facility at the Cancer Research
UK Cambridge Institute.

The following deployments are available:

[CRUK-CI server](https://bioinformatics.cruk.cam.ac.uk/stats/shinystats)

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/crukci-bioinformatics/shinystats/master?urlpath=shiny)

Please note that the Binder deployment is not always reliable and sometimes
fails to start with a 500: Internal Server Error: "could not start shiny in
time".
